## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**IP** | **List&lt;Integer&gt;** | Note that in this documentation, referring to an IP address as an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address is a semantic property of the address, not just the length of the byte slice: a 16-byte slice can still be an IPv4 address. |  [optional]
**mask** | **List&lt;Integer&gt;** |  |  [optional]
